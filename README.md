# Breeze Style Window Controls for Visual Studio Code [WIP]

By default, VSCode ships with two window controls option: `custom` and `native`. If you use `native`, it adds compositor managed window title bar which is not really if you need more vertical screen space. Choosing `custom` injects Win11 style window controls, and that stands out when it's next to native or native like windows.

And here is a fix for this. Using VSCode's internal UI icon theme [`codicon`](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) components, this style replaces those icons to match Breeze default window control icons.
